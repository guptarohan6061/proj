Paste screenshots of your results into a Word file, save your Word file as `ice_lastname_firstname.docx`. Please provide comments on your results in the Word file.

### Advanced Concepts of Time Series
For the following exercise, use the data file [global.txt](/data/global.txt). Use the year 1856 as the starting point with 12 as the frequency. 

The data contains values for global temperature. Please perform the following tasks:
* Determine whether or not your data is stationary. Use an objective assessment and a subjective one. If it is not stationary, how many times must you difference it to obtain stationarity? (2 pts.)
* Propose at least three different models for your data and justify your decision. Use correlograms and partial correlograms as part of your justification. (3 pts.)
* Estimate the components of your models and perform diagnostics. Select one of your models as the final selection and justify your decision. (3 pts.)
* Forecast your models and assess each one. Which model performs the best? Is it consistent with the model you selected in the previous step? (2 pts.)
